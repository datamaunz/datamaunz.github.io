## Networking

> allow connectivity between different end hosts on the network

## Characteristics

### Topology

- how are the devices connected to each other?

#### Example

**Office 1**

- Local Area Network
    - [PC], [Server], [Printer], [Laptop -> wireless access point] -> switch
- Router
- Firewall
- Internet

**Office 2**

- Local Area Network
    - [PC], [Server], [Laptop] -> switch
- Router
- Firewall
- Internet

Communication between Office 1 and Office 2:
1. over the internet
2. wide area connection: dedicated connection between both routers

### Speed

- usually the faster the more costly

### Cost

- obviously, the cheaper the better (if not causing other conflicts)

### Security

- Firewall
- security features on routers, and switches
- intrusion intervention systems
- etc

### Availability

- make sure the network always stays up
- strategy of doubling up on components such that if one fails another can take over

### Scalability

- design network such that it can grow with the company without requiring redesign

### Reliability

- make sure the network continues to work
